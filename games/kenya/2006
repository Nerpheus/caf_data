*   record at withdrawal              17  7  4  6  18-18  25  Disbanded
*
*NB: Coast Stars had their matches on May 19 (vs Sony, 0-2) and Oct 7
*    (vs World Hope 1-1) awarded 2-0 wins (for having fielded ineligible
*    players) by the KFF IDAT (Independent Disciplinary and Appeals
*    Tribunal) on Jan 23, 2008 (sic!), implying KCB were to be relegated 
*    in their stead; however, on Jan 26, the KPL (Kenya Premier League),
*    at a meeting of the KPL Senior Management Committee attended by 14
*    of the 16 clubs, unanimously refused to acknowledge this decision on
*    the grounds there had not been a quorum at the IDAT meeting and that
*    it had not met and decided within the stipulated 30 days (Coast Stars'
*    appeal had been submitted Dec 10, 2007); an additional issue is that
*    Coast Stars went directly to the KFF IDAT instead of to the KPL IDAC (Independent Disciplinary and 
*    Appeals Committee); it is probably no coincidence that Coast Stars
*    are run by KFF chairman Mohammed Hatimy, also in control of the KFF 
*    "I"DAT.  In February, it was decided to ask FIFA for a binding advice
*    on Coast Stars' status 2008.  On February 28, 2008, the FIFA Division
*    for Legal Affairs delivered its judgment, tearing the procedures
*    followed by the KFF IDAT (which reinstated Coast Stars) into very
*    small pieces.  KCB therefore remain at the top level.  Coast Stars
*    are planning to appeal at ordinary courts.
*
*NB: 2 more losses than wins due to award Ulinzi vs Agro on Mar 18
*
*NB: 4 teams to be relegated and 2 promoted as top level is reduced to
*    16 clubs;
*    on June 29, 2007, it was announced Mumias Sugar were disbanded;
*    all their results (listed between square brackets for opponents)
*    were annulled; due to this, 3 (other) teams are to be relegated 
*    instead of 4;
*    on October 18, Kangemi United were disqualified and forcibly
*    relegated due to to many no-shows;  all their results (listed 
*    between curly brackets for opponents) were annulled; due to this,
*    2 (other) teams are to be relegated 
*
*Notes:
*
*Just before the season, the Kenya FA decided to set up their
*own league, KFF PL, in an apparent effort to dismantle the
*existing KPL.  Relegated teams Shabana and AFC Leopards have
*been added to make the league consist of 20 clubs; Kangemi
*United had already replaced disbanded Securicor.
*
*Meanwhile, the Kenya Premier League (KPL) had not only demoted
*Shabana and AFC Leopards (among others) but also denied entrance
*to promoted clubs Mahakama and Homegrown, in order to reduce
*the top level to 16 teams.
*
*Since Sep 16, both bodies have been fixturing matches without
*regard for the other.  A meeting on Oct 2 attended by 12 clubs
*supposedly agreed to unify the league under KFF-PL, starting 
*at Oct 16; however, the clubs could not agree on the number
*of participants. On Oct 4, the Kenya Premier League was 
*deregistered after two of its shareholders, AFC Leopards and 
*Gor Mahia (both relegated last season...), agreed to do so.
*That administrative move does not seem to have had any further
*effect.
*   
*FIFA interfered, in the person of Jérôme Champagne, stating it 
*agrees with Gor Mahia remaining in the top flight but insists 
*on the relegation of AFC Leopards and Shabana and a reduction 
*to 18 clubs.  Champagne also publicly denied the KFF to have a 
*mandate to run the league.
*
*In spite of the supposed agreement on Oct 2, both leagues kept 
*fixturing matches, most of which were not played.  This led to
*the fairly ridiculous situation of Sony Sugar, champions 2006,
*being fixtured for two different matches on Oct 14 in spite of
*its chairman, Gabriel Otiende, being installed as 'boss' of
*both KFF-PL and KPL.
*
*On Oct 24, 2006, FIFA suspended the KFF.
* 
*Later, the government dissolved the KFF, a decision suspended by
*the High Court.
*
*A new Premier League season was announced to start on Nov 25 with 
*20 teams but did not, both existing leagues continuing.
*
*On Mar 9, 2007, FIFA lifted Kenya's suspension, with the composition
*of the Premier League to be decided at the AGM of the KFF.  This new
*'unified' league started on Mar 10, 2007; all 'old' matches were 
*carried over apart from those involving AFC Leopards and Shabana.
*
*
*Kenya Premier League (KPL) 
*
*NB: was to have 16 teams; promoted clubs Mahakama and Homegrown were
*    originally denied entrance, but later admitted, apparently after
*    pressure from FIFA.  However, most teams, including champions Sony
*    Sugar, have opted to play in the KFF PL (see below), Sony for
*    fear of being denied entrance in the CAF Champions League 2007.
*    Eleven clubs, viz. Mathare United, Coast Stars, Mathare Youth, 
*    World Hope, Ulinzi, Sony Sugar, Sher Agencies, Thika United, 
*    Mumias Sugar, Tusker and Kenya Commercial Bank, called for
*    the dissolution of the KFF PL.  Six of them, Mathare United,
*    Mathare Youth, Tusker, Sher Agencies, World Hope and Thika United 
*    refused to play in the KFF PL.

   record at withdrawal              17  7  4  6  18-18  25  Disbanded

NB: Coast Stars had their matches on May 19 (vs Sony, 0-2) and Oct 7
    (vs World Hope 1-1) awarded 2-0 wins (for having fielded ineligible
    players) by the KFF IDAT (Independent Disciplinary and Appeals
    Tribunal) on Jan 23, 2008 (sic!), implying KCB were to be relegated 
    in their stead; however, on Jan 26, the KPL (Kenya Premier League),
    at a meeting of the KPL Senior Management Committee attended by 14
    of the 16 clubs, unanimously refused to acknowledge this decision on
    the grounds there had not been a quorum at the IDAT meeting and that
    it had not met and decided within the stipulated 30 days (Coast Stars'
    appeal had been submitted Dec 10, 2007); an additional issue is that
    Coast Stars went directly to the KFF IDAT instead of to the KPL IDAC (Independent Disciplinary and 
    Appeals Committee); it is probably no coincidence that Coast Stars
    are run by KFF chairman Mohammed Hatimy, also in control of the KFF 
    "I"DAT.  In February, it was decided to ask FIFA for a binding advice
    on Coast Stars' status 2008.  On February 28, 2008, the FIFA Division
    for Legal Affairs delivered its judgment, tearing the procedures
    followed by the KFF IDAT (which reinstated Coast Stars) into very
    small pieces.  KCB therefore remain at the top level.  Coast Stars
    are planning to appeal at ordinary courts.

NB: 2 more losses than wins due to award Ulinzi vs Agro on Mar 18

NB: 4 teams to be relegated and 2 promoted as top level is reduced to
    16 clubs;
    on June 29, 2007, it was announced Mumias Sugar were disbanded;
    all their results (listed between square brackets for opponents)
    were annulled; due to this, 3 (other) teams are to be relegated 
    instead of 4;
    on October 18, Kangemi United were disqualified and forcibly
    relegated due to to many no-shows;  all their results (listed 
    between curly brackets for opponents) were annulled; due to this,
    2 (other) teams are to be relegated 


NB: as cup winners Sofapaka declined to enter the 2008 CAF
    Confederation Cup for financial reasons, losing finalists 
    Homegrown have been asked whether they are interested; 
    if not the Kenyan place may go to league runners-up
    Mathare United.

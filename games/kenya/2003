Season: 2003-2004

*NB: due to the conflict between KFF, meanwhile dissolved by the Kenyan
*    sports minister and replaced by the STC (Stake-holders Transition
*    Committee), and most leading clubs united in the ICCG (later KPFG),
*    two leagues are being played in the 2003/04 season.  Both are to be
*    finished on June 30, and a unified league supposedly will start on
*    September 1 for the 2004/05 season (see below).

NB: competition suspended due to dissolution of KFF by government.  Because
    of the lack of competitive action, Ulinzi Stars have announced they will
    enter the 2004 Transparency Cup organised by the rival Kenya Football Group.
    League supposedly resumes on May 8, though Securicor, Red Berets, Shabana,
    Administration Police, Chemelil Sugar, Sony Sugar, Ulinzi Stars, Coast Stars
    and Re-Union all announced their withdrawal on April 28.

    to be leading the league with 46 points (in which case they should 
    won 7 and drew 2 of their remaining 9 matches)

[*] w/o goals Red Berets vs Administration Police, Red Berets vs Kangemi
[-]  12 clubs, viz. Mathare United, Mumias Sugar, AFC Leopards,
     Nzoia Sugar, Gor Mahia, Kenya Pipeline, Thika United, Tusker, 
     Sher Agencies, Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB), Kisumu Telkom and 
     Utalii, left the league to form the Kenya National Football
     League (KNFL), which is to start on Oct 7.  The KFF threw out 
     10 of the clubs (all except AFC Leopards and Kisumu Telkom,
     apparently on the grounds that these attended a KFF meeting).
     The president of AFC Leopards is insisting KFF should not use
     the name of 'his' club in the fixtures, but the players appear
     happy to turn out for the KFF matches.
[+]  instead the KFF promoted Shabana, Sony Sugar, Cook 'N Lite, 
     Re-Union, Securicor, Kangemi United and Kawangware to create
     a league of 15 teams; of these, Kawangware have announced that
     they cannot enter at such short notice. 
[*1] Kawangware were excluded on Nov 11 after failing to play a match.
[*2] Cook 'N Lite were excluded mid-January for failing to show for
     their away matches; it is unclear what happens to the matches
     they already played (or had awarded against them).

     In addition, KFF have stripped Nzoia Sugar of their 2002/03
     championship.

Sep 11 to 19; participants:
KFF (4):
   Chemelil Sugar (Nyando)   
   Coast Stars (Mombasa)     
   Ulinzi Stars (Thika)   
   SoNy Sugar (Awendo)   
KPFG (4):
   Tusker FC (Nairobi)
   Medisca Thika United   
   Kenya Pipeline (Nairobi) 
   Mathare United (replace Utalii who withdrew due to lack of sponsorship)

NB: to be played in Afraha stadium, Nakuru; Thika and Mathare withdrew
    complaining about the costs of staying there for one week rather than
    organising the tournament in Nairobi.

Originally the tournament was to be played on a knock-out basis, Thika
having been scheduled to meet Chemelil (the winners meeting the winners
of Pipeline vs Ulinzi in the semifinals) and Mathare to play Coast Stars 
(the winners playing the winners of Tusker vs Sony in the semifinals),
but after the double withdrawal two 3-team groups were set up.

           David Odidi, Oscar Kadenge missed]

NB: Ulinzi are qualified for the CECAFA club championship, but as they 
    are under a 3-year suspension from CAF tournaments, Tusker take their 
    place in the (qualifying for the) CAF Champions League and Chemelil
    (as  third placed team) enter the CAF Confederations Cup.


Transparency Cup 2004

organised by the KPFG

NB: Kisumu City, Umri, De La Rue and Makongeni were reported as
    entries earlier but eventually failed to meet registration
    deadline of April 10.  The same applied to the teams from the
    KFF/STC Premier League, of which Ulinzi Stars and Chemelil Sugar
    had explicitly stated their interest in joining the competition,
    but on request of the Stakeholders Transitional Committee (STC)
    the KPFG agreed to have maximally 8 new teams inscribed in the
    competition, to register by May 5, 1 pm.  These 8 teams are to
    play a separate knock-out competition until two teams are left
    which then enter the main tournament with 6 remaining teams from
    the original sompetition at the quarterfinal stage.
